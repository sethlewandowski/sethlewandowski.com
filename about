  <h2>So, Seth, tell me your life story!</h2>
    <p>OMG, I'm flattered you asked!</p>
    <p>Kidding, but for real, if you've landed on this page somehow (God help you),
      then you've gotta be at least a little bit curious about my life story.<br>
      So, here it goes.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><small>1992</small></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Born and raised in Tulsa, OK.</p>
        <p>Attended Christian private schools all the way to college.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><small>2010</small></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Started my college career at Oral Roberts University and decided to run track as a multi-event athlete.</p>
        <p>Getting slightly tired of manditory hall devotionals and midnight room checks, I decided to cash it in on ORU and transfer to OU. #Boomer</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><small>2011</small></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>I walked on to the track team there and loved every minute.<br>
          Well, most minutes.</p>
        <p>Studied finance and made a lot of great friends through track and the business college.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><small>2014</small></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>First job was in corporate america as a financial analyst at ONEOK. It was very exciting feeling like I landed the job of a lifetime...<br>
        I ended up quitting after 8 months with no job lined up.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <small>2015</small>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>After ONEOK, I decided to GTFO of Tulsa so I traded my BMW in for a Toyota Prius nammed Sammy and headed west to the Golden State.<br> Thus began my first 3 month stint sleeping on a couch and driving for Lyft.</p>
      <p>This was about the time in my life I decided I wanted to be an entrepreneur.<br>
        Problem was, when you're sharing a 2 bed 1 bath in Alamo Square splitting the
        $4,350 rent with your brother, you realize pretty quick that your $10,000 worth
      of life savings is gonna run out pretty quick. Time for a big boy job? Yep.</p>
      <p>So I started applying for jobs to make enough money to make ends meet then 
        put all the rest of my time into starting businesses. Sounds like a good plan, right?<br>Wrong.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <small>2015</small>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>I got a job at Funding Circle, an online small business lender, as an Account Manager which was really just a glorified name for customer success.</p>
        <p>A year flew by so quickly. New friends, new experiences. Masssive growth in my abilities and skills. But again, something was just... missing.<br>
        Also, I'm an introvert and I can only slam phones for so long before breaking down as a human being.</p>
        <p>After a few unsuccessful efforts to transfer roles within the company, I put in my two weeks after a year and a half of working there with no job lined up.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <small>2016</small>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>I ended up getting a call from my Dad asking me to come help him with one of his businesses. I took the job and started the day after my last day at Funding Circle.</p>
        <p>I joined a company called SONO as a project manager and started drumming up data interface relationships between SONO and Electronic Medical Records companies for the benefit of SONO's customers. This was a long and gruling process which forced me to start to learn technology venacular at a "drinking out of a firehose" rate.</p>
        <p>Shortly after joining SONO, I decided it was time to start a business and try this whole "entrepreneurship" thing. My best friend Jordan and I were already in regular touch discussing what businesses we could start so we hit the ground running.</p>
      <dt>
        <small>2017</small>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>I convinced my Dad that he should start a podcast and I would run it for him.</p>
        <p>This is when I was forced to build my first website. I had NO idea how to even get started building a website. After 8 hours of research online, I signed up for this thing called Squarespace and got started.</p>
        <p>2 weeks later, I had a website up and running and was learning how to produce a podcast track and sign up for a podcast hosting provider.</p>
        <p>The podcast, website, and blog posts developed from this venture are still up and available to see at <a href="https://drmarklew.com/podcast">his website.</a></p>
        <p>After a call to our recently laid-off high school friend, <a href="https://www.goperiwinkle.com">Periwinkle</a> was born.</p>
        <p>The lessons I learned from this experience can and likely will fill a book someday. This was my real world MBA and caused me as much stress and lost sleep as an MBA program would.</p>
        <p>As the only co-founder of 4 with any sort of technical experience (yes, building a squarespace website made me the technical co-founder of the 4), I took the role of Finance, Accounting, and Technology for Periwinkle.</p>
        <p>About 3 years have gone by since I joined SONO and started Periwinkle.</p>
        <p>Through my role as the "tech" guy at Periwinkle and managing a content marketing website though SONO, I discovered that what I loved most about my job was solving problems with technology. This was when I decided to start agressively pursuing my software and web development skillsets.</p>

      <dd>
        <p>I finished my first website built from scratch. I can't provide a link to it, because you're on it!</p>
        <p>Then, I decided to rebuild my <a href="https://www.goperiwinkle.com">businesses website</a> from scratch. It was originally built on squarespace but I wanted to rebuild it from scratch because, well, squarespace is not exactly fast.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <small>2020</small>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>I finally decided to move to sunnier pastures. I have self-diagnosed myself with <a href="https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/seasonal-affective-disorder#1">SAD</a> and I finally had enough of dreading the winter so I decided to move to Scottsdale, AZ where I now reside.</p>
        <p>This year, I will be launching my mobile app to help make the world of feedback better. You can follow this journey <a href="/projects/reviews">here.</a></p>
