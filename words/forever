<h1>Nothing Lasts Forever</h1>

<p>
Nothing lasts forever.<br>
There's beauty in the statement.<br>
But there's also pain in the statement.
</p><p>
How do we cope with the knowledge that all good things must eventually come to an end?
</p><p>
What if everything was permanent?
Would it be quite as beautiful?
</p><p>
I think having the knowledge in the back of your mind that everything is fluid, and nothing is guaranteed, can help us live better lives. 
</p><p>
Is it painful to imagine a world where you can't call your dad and ask him to come check out your faulty air conditioner?<br>
You bet it is.<br>
But consider how much more present you might be with him if you allowed yourself to ponder that reality every now and then.
</p><p>
It's true, you know.<br>
You can hate me for writing this.<br>
Hate me for challenging you to consider this idea.<br>
But at the end of the day, whether you choose to embrace it or not, it's a reality that we all face. 
</p><p>
I guess it's really all about not taking things for granted in a world where we take everything for granted. 
</p><p>
When's the last time you had to worry about finding clean drinking water?
Sustenance?
</p><p>
Instead, we find ourselves worrying about how well our instagram followers will receive our latest story post. 
</p><p>
If we were to embrace the truth that any day our world could end.<br>
Our relationships could end.<br>
We could end.<br>
<strong>How much more rich might our lives be?</strong>
