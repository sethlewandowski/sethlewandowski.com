<h1>The Sand or The Shell</h1>

Looking back on our lives, I think we can all recall times when we've made efforts to blend in.<br>
To fit in.
</p><p>
It starts as a child, way before we realize what's happening.<br>
Elementary, middle, high school. <br>
Even college and into the workplace. 
</p><p>
We all just want to fit in.<br>
Have friends. <br>
Be "normal".<br>
It has to be in our DNA to want to fit in.<br>
A survival mechanism that self selected it's way into humanity.
</p><p>
What's crazy about this is not the phenomenon itself, but the irony of it.<br>
The irony of our admiration for people and ideas that are "different".<br>
Even Steve Jobs saw the value in this idea demonstrated by Apple's "Think different." motto.
</p><p>
So we admire and aspire to be like these "different" world shapers, yet our innate survival impulse is to quietly blend in?
</p><p>

When we walk on a beach, we often look down at our feet making prints in the sand.<br>
What do we notice?<br>
Do we notice the single grain of sand next to our big toe?<br>
Or do we notice the purple sea shell 3 feet to our left?
</p><p>
Difference, not size or proximity, is what makes us notice the sea shell. 
</p><p>
And this makes me wonder:
</p><p>
Why do we try so hard to be like sand, when we could be our own shell?
</p><p>
What might we be, dream, create, or change?
</p><p>
I guess that's for some to wonder and few to find out.
