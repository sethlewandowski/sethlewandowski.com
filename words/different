<h3>Do you have one of those friends that always seem to say, “Man, I just want to be a millionaire and live on a beach”?</h3>
<p>
What’s the problem with dreaming big?
</p><p>
No problem.<br>
No problem at all.<br>
In fact, I love being around people with big dreams and ambitions.<br>
It’s inspiring.<br>
It’s energizing.<br>
It’s my kind of dinner conversation.
</p><p>
The problem is that so many people want big things, big houses, fancy cars, small islands, big jets, big companies, and big bank accounts, yet we all seem to be doing a terrible job resisting conformity.
</p><p>
What I mean by this, is whether consciously or unconsciously, we are all terrible at telling society to go climb a tree and being our complete, unapologetic selves. Our true selves to our core.
</p><p>
The thing about people that start a successful business and really make it big, is they usually are told by everyone, even their loved ones, that they should go back and get a job.<br>
That they should stop working on that idea and go spend more time with their kids.<br>
That they should “Be realistic” about their ambitions and careers.
</p><p>
It’s totally messed up, but sometimes the people who love us most are the ones keeping us from changing the world.<br>
I know it sounds like I am blowing this out of proportion, but I mean this and believe it.<br>
In fact, I’ve personally dealt with this issue already with a business partner of mine, and I’m only just starting out in the game of solving problems for the world.
</p><p>
<strong>If you want a different life than those around you, you have to stop doing the same things they are doing.</strong><br>
What I am trying to say is, if you want to be a millionaire before you are 30, then my hat is off to you.<br>
Here’s the problem.<br>
Few people achieve that milestone by that age.<br>
In fact, very, very few people achieve that milestone when you consider the entire world’s population.
</p><p>
It’s awesome to have big goals, big ambitions, big ideas.<br>
God knows our world needs more people who are willing to put it all on the line to make a difference in our world.<br>
But, if you are one of these people, and you are doing the same stuff every day that everyone else around you is doing, you know the drill:
<ol>
<li>Waking up.</li>
<li>Eating breakfast.</li>
<li>Going to work.</li>
<li>Going out for beers with friends.</li>
<li>Going home and watching Netflix.</li>
<li>Then doing it all over again.</li>
</ol>
</p><p>
How can you expect a different result?<br>
It’s not going to fall out of the sky just because you want something.
</p><p>
<strong>Want a lifestyle that most people don’t have?</strong><br>
Stop doing what most people are doing.<br>
Stop spending like most people are spending.<br>
Stop working like most people are working.<br>
Stop thinking like most people are thinking.<br>
Stop spending your free time like most people are spending their free time.
</p><p>
You get my point.
</p><p>
This one is a big one for me.<br>
And no, Not because I read it in a textbook, not because I heard it from a mentor, not because I saw it on an inspirational Youtube video, it’s simply because IT MAKES LOGICAL SENSE.
</p><p>
<strong>Pull yourself out of the masses and embrace your uniqueness and cultivate your curiosity, ambition, and ideas.</strong><br>
We need fewer people chasing money and job titles and more people solving the problems of millions of people.<br>
Funny thing is, the more people you can help, the more money will usually follow.<br>
Go find ways to help people.
</p><p>
But most of all,
</p><p>
<strong>If you want a life that is different from most, you must start doing things differently than most.</strong>
