<p>
What if you could go back to a time in your life and be able to say something that you had left unsaid?<br>
Would you say it?<br>
Would it change things?
</p><p>
Why is it easier to leave words unsaid?<br>
Are we just afraid of rejection?<br>
Or is it the uncertainty that we fear?
</p><p>
The right words said to the right person at the right time can bring incredible feelings of life, happiness, and companionship, but take out any one of those three and you have a recipe for disaster.
</p><p>
Ironically, saying exactly what we mean is often easier said than done.
</p><p>
I can tell you, personally, I ahve left many things unsaid to peopl ethat are no longer in my life, and I wonder if things would be any different had I said them.<br>
Different?<br>
Yes, very likely.<br>
Better or worse?<br>
It’s hard to say.
</p><p>
What if next time you are speaking with a close friend, family member, colleague, or loved one, you imagined waking up the next day and never being able to speak to that person ever again?<br>
What would you say?<br>
How would you act?<br>
What would you do?
</p><p>
We all too often walk through life taking each day and each person in it for granted.<br>
As if it was guaranteed that tomorrow we would all wake up and have the same opportunities to say or do something.<br>
The reality is, every day is a gift and our futures are all but certain.
</p><p>
So it’s probably not worth leaving those words unsaid after all.
