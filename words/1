<p>
I’ll be honest.<br>
I’m guilty.<br>
It’s a hard bullet to dodge.<br>
Kinda like walking out in the pouring rain and expecting not to get wet.<br>
It’s just not gonna happen.<br>
You’re gonna get wet.<br>
Unless you live your entire life indoors.<br>
You will get wet.
</p><p>
How much of our world is built by the expectations of other people?<br>
Sure we might be laying the brick.<br>
But who’s writing the blueprint?
</p><p>
When you struck out on your own, why did you do it?<br>
Did your parents want you to?<br>
Did your partner want you to?<br>
Did you watch The Social Network and want to be the hero?<br>
I’m not saying you should be ashamed if any of this strikes a chord.<br>
Remember walking out into the rain and expecting not to get wet?<br>
It doesn’t happen.<br>
We all get wet.<br>
Regardless of how hard we try to defend against it.
</p><p>
The role of influence in our life is an important one.<br>
And a freaking strong one.<br>
Regardless of how hard we may try.<br>
We can’t completely protect ourselves from it.<br>
By nature, we want to please other people.<br>
It makes us feel good.<br>
It makes others feel good.<br>
It’s human nature.<br>
Biologically programmed.
</p><p>
But what about the butterfly effect?<br>
What if you want to write a novel but you’re convinced by others you should write a screenplay?<br>
What if you make millions of dollars on your screenplay?<br>
What if your screenplay catapults your career and makes you famous?<br>
What if your screenplay changes thousands of people’s lives?<br>
Does that mean that you did the right thing?<br>
Does that mean that you’re living your destiny?
</p><p>
The sad truth is <strong>sometimes it’s the ones who love us most that can hold us back the most</strong>.<br>
The ones that are there for you in the hard times.<br>
The ones that will give you the shirt off their back.<br>
The ones that prove this life is worth living.
</p><p>
How much of what we do is influenced by a desire to please our parents?<br>
Our best friend?<br>
Our spouse?<br>
Our brother?<br>
Our mentors?
</p><p>
How much of what we do gets ever so slightly influenced away from our true vision?<br>
We know we can’t go outside in the rain and not get wet.<br> 
That’s a fact.<br>
A given.<br>
A constant.
</p><p>
So how much of our world is different because we can’t help but get wet?
</p><p>
As much as people may try.<br>
Truly, honestly, deeply try.<br>
And even make a living trying.<br>
We just can’t get inside each other’s heads.<br>
We can’t know what other people know.<br>
See what other people see.<br>
Hear what other people hear.<br>
Dream what other people dream.
</p><p>
We just can’t do it.
</p><p>
But we try!<br>
We have to.<br>
That’s how we attempt to understand each other.<br>
So there’s a disconnect.<br>
And with that disconnect, advice is given.<br>
Influence is placed.<br>
Coordinates are changed.
</p><p>
Would this world be different?
</p><p>
Would this world be different if we didn’t go outside?<br>
If we never got wet?<br>
If we created things uninfluenced by others.<br>
Uninfluenced by our well intentioned loved ones.<br>
They care about us.<br>
They love us.<br>
We are their blood.<br>
We are part of them.<br>
They want what’s best for us.<br>
They want us to change the world.<br>
To be a difference.<br>
To leave this place better than we found it.
</p><p>
But sadly, it’s our good intentions that alter the course of history.<br>
These aren’t big changes that we influence.<br>
Just small tweaks.<br>
Here and there.<br>
Nothing big.<br>
Just small tweaks.<br>
But as we understand with the butterfly effect.<br>
One small change can have drastic, long-term impact.
</p><p>
If you’ve heard the airplane example.<br>
You know that an airplane flying 1 degree off course.<br>
On a trip from LAX to NYC.<br>
Will end up 50 miles off course.<br>
How far off course would you end up over a lifetime of being 1 degree off course.
</p><p>
Okay so now what.<br>
We’ve established we have to go outside.<br>
We can’t help people from inside a cardboard box.<br>
We’ve established we can’t help but get wet.<br>
Regardless of how much rain gear we put on.<br>
And you’re telling me that getting even a little wet could change everything?
</p><p>
Yes.
</p><p>
I am.
</p><p>
<strong>What can we do about it?</strong><br>
This is the question that really matters here.<br>
What can we do about it?
</p><p>
We could ignore people?<br>
Ignore our friends, family, loved ones.<br>
That could work?<br>
We could invest in better rain gear?<br>
Waterproof boots, massive umbrella, drench-coat.<br>
Okay, that would help.
</p><p>
But maybe it’s best just to be aware?<br>
We tend to like to optimize for everything.<br>
Optimize for sleep.<br>
Optimize for health.<br>
Optimize for work.<br>
Us type-A’s, we are professional optimizers.
</p><p>
Is this a situation where we give up the optimizing and embrace the rain?
</p><p>
Maybe.<br> 
Maybe that’s it.<br>
Be aware.<br>
Be aware that the people who love us most can sometimes hurt us the most.<br> 
Be aware that good intentions can have negative impact.<br>
Be aware that no one, and I mean NO ONE can get inside our heads and see it from our perspective.<br>
Hell, we couldn’t paint the picture for others if we tried.
</p><p>
What if we were just hyper-aware that well-intentioned people could knock us off course.<br>
Not 90 degrees off course.<br>
We are stronger than that.<br>
But 2 degrees off?<br>
1 degree off?
</p><p>
Consider for a second.<br>
How far off your intended destination you’d be.<br>
After 85 years of walking just 1 degree off course.<br>
And most of us creators wouldn’t exactly say we are walking.<br>
Would we?
</p><p>
How often do you stop and ask yourself:<br>
Is this really me?<br>
Is this me?<br>
Am I following my dreams?<br>
Or someone’s dreams for me?<br>
What am I chasing?<br>
Money?<br>
Status?<br>
Power?<br>
What’s driving me?<br>
Am I still on course?
</p><p>
We are billions of people running around in a large mob unintentionally knocking each other just a couple degrees off our intended course.
</p><p>
And the world in front of us is a result of people attempting to get to their final destination after being knocked off course just a few degrees here and there.
</p><p>
Did they get back on course?<br>
Did they course correct?<br>
Did they still make it to their final destination?<br>
Did it really change anything in the end?<br>
Could our world be better as a result?
</p><p>
When’s the last time you looked down at your compass?<br>
Who is in your life that’s trying to help you but could be knocking you off course?<br>
When our time on this earth ends, how far will we be from our final destination?
</p><p>
We really can’t know.<br>
Maybe just being aware is enough?
</p><p>
For all our sakes, I sure hope it is.
