<h1>Is He Self-made?</h1>
<small>March 15, 2019</small>
</header>

<p>
It’s a question we’ve all heard before,<br>
But I think very few realize its incredible power.
</p><p>
And I’m not talking about power for good, unfortunately.
</p><p>
The problem with this question is very subtle and is missed by far too many.<br>
And if people really understood what this question does, they would be far more cautious to ask it.
</p><dl>

<dd>Nick Redwine</dd>
</dl><p>
This question causes controversy – a lot of controversy.<br>
If it didn’t, Forbes and other media outlets wouldn’t use it in their headlines.<br>
They aren’t stupid.
</p><p>
If they wrote articles that didn’t create controversy, no one would read them.
</p><p>
"Is he self-made?"
</p><p>
Personally, my issue with this question, and specifically, this word, is that while it is usually used to compliment someone,<br>
To pat them on the back and say, “Hey nice work! You did this on your own!”<br>
What it really does is puts the person and their achievements into a frame of mind where we can disarm them and discredit them.
</p><p>
“Oh of course she’s not self-made! She used her last name!”
</p><p>
“No, he’s not self-made, he inherited 100K when his dad died!”
</p><p>
“Everyone says they’re self-made but their parents bought their ivy league admission.”
</p><p>
"Is she self-made?"
</p><p>
The problem with this question is that it gives people an out.<br>
It gives people a justification as to why someone is flying a private jet home for Thanksgiving, while the rest of us are packed in like sardines waiting for our Southwest flight to board.
</p><p>
<i>Oh, by the way, I’m B-33, what are you?</i>
</p><p>
The problem with this question is that it draws the focus to the wrong thing.
</p><p>
<strong>Whether people earned their current status or whether they inherited it.</strong>
</p><p>
This is the wrong question to be asking.<br>
It’s the wrong question to be focusing on.<br>
It’s the wrong question to be thinking about.
</p><p>
Being called “Self-made” by people is kinda like graduating from high school with honors.<br>
Yeah, wow it’s great to have that special gold sash at graduation.<br>
It makes you feel like a badass to have a different color sash than everyone else.<br>
But once you go home, no one will ever care again.<br>
It won’t get you a job.<br>
It won’t help you help more people.<br>
It won’t make you more money.<br>
It won’t matter.
</p><p>
It will end up in a cardboard box buried deep somewhere in your attic.<br>
Never again to be seen by anyone.<br>
Never again to be worn.
</p><p>
"Are they self-made?"
</p><p>
The reason this is the wrong question is because at the end of the day,<br>
It doesn’t matter what we were given at the beginning of our journey.
</p><p>
Some people are going to be given a last name and lots of money.<br>
Some people are going to be given a “normal” childhood with great memories.<br>
Some people are going to be given an incredible voice.<br>
Some people are going to be given wonderful parents.<br>
Some people are going to be given world-class athletic ability.<br>
Some people are going to be given jaw-dropping artistic abilities.
</p><p>
My point here is, whether you know it or not, you have been given something that other people haven’t.<br>
You have something that other people don’t.<br>
And if you don’t believe me, then you aren’t looking hard enough.<br>
Everyone and I mean EVERYONE has been given an advantage of some sort.
</p><p>
I am a 6’1″ white boy from Tulsa, Oklahoma and I went to OU to compete in the Decathlon.<br>
My Olympic medal-winning coach and I used to laugh because of the vast difference in natural athletic ability between me and some of the men I competed against.<br>
I often got my ass kicked.<br>
And I mean kicked.
</p><p>
We laughed because something we both knew and agreed on was that everyone is born with different eggs in their basket.
</p><p>
Something I haven’t really told many people is that during practice on finals week, he would often let me out early to go study.<br>
He and I both knew I wasn’t going pro in Track and Field.<br>
You’ve seen the commercials.<br>
“X% of NCAA Division 1 college athletes will go pro in something other than their sport.”
</p><p>
I was part of this “X%”.
</p><p>
Some people are given the athletic egg.<br>
Some people are given the intelligence egg.<br>
Some people are given the entrepreneurial egg.<br>
Some people are given the creativity egg.<br>
Some people are given the musical egg.<br>
Some people are given the people egg.
</p>
<h3>We are all born with different eggs in our baskets.</h3>
<p>
So it’s not our job to determine whether someone is self-made or not.<br>
It’s our job to figure out what eggs were put in our basket and decide what we’re going to do with them.
</p><p>
It doesn’t matter what we were given at the beginning of our journey,<br>
It matters what we do with what we were given.
</p><p>
It matters what we do with what we were given.
</p><p>
So let me ask you a question.
</p><p>
What are you going to do with what you were given?
