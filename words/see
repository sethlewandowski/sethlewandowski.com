<h1>I Can't Help But See</h1>

<p>
After waiting in line for what seemed like a solid 30 minutes, I walked through the smoky doors and immediately knew this was a different kind of night.<br>
But I just couldn’t quite put my finger on it.<br>
Some call it the mood.<br>
Others call it the feels.<br>
I call it the vibe.
</p><p>
To the left were the normal working stiffs – Sportcoats, heels, and all.<br>
Sipping their tequila sodas chatting about their two co-workers hooking up the weekend before.
</p><p>
As I passed them, I couldn’t help remember standing in the circle myself.<br>
Smiling and sipping.<br>
Sipping and smiling.<br>
Laughing on cue.
</p><p>
Dance monkey dance!<br>
It was all just a game.<br>
A game that took everything I had to keep up.
</p><p><i>
What’s different about this place?<br>
Is it this place or this night?<br>
Man, am I feeling okay?<br>
Time for a drink. Maybe that’s it.
</i></p><p>
I crammed into the pack of wild animals stacked up against the bar.<br>
Wallets full.<br>
Stomaches empty. (We’re here to drink people)<br>
It’s the bay area after all.<br>
You gotta spend that tech dough on something.<br>
Game faces on.<br>
Every night’s a chance to get lucky.
</p><p>
This game is my favorite.<br>
<strong>Who’s the best combination of tall and good-looking?</strong>
</p><p>
I haven’t come across any official document, but from experience, I’ve figured out that the pecking order goes something like this:
<ol>
  <li>Beautiful tall woman</li>
  <li>Beautiful woman</li>
  <li>Beautiful tall woman approaching</li>
  <li>Handsome tall man</li>
  <li>Woman who’s been waiting for the longest</li>
  <li>Handsome man</li>
  <li>Man who’s been waiting for the longest</li>
</ol>
</p><p>
Does this pecking order piss you off a little?<br>
If it does, you’re probably not a beautiful tall woman.<br>
If it doesn’t, and you’re single, well, you know how to get in touch.
</p><p>
This is where being a tall person has probably had the biggest payoff.<br>
Sure you could argue sports and all that, but that’s boring.<br>
Being high on the bartender attention pecking order is what life’s all about.<br>
This is what we tall people live for.<br>
It’s our payback for airplane seats.<br>
Thanks, Boeing.
</p><p>
“Vodka soda, please.”<br>
Ordering drinks at a bar is one of the few places you can yell at someone and use improper English while still keepin’ it classy.<br>
Then comes the glances from the people shorter than me that have been waiting much longer.<br>
<i>Come on, come on, come on.<br>
Pour that vodka man and get me out of this lion’s den.</i>
</p><p>
Thank God we are taught to read top to bottom.
</p><p>
The first sip is icy, smooth, talkative, confident me.<br>
And it goes down like honey.<br>
<i>Alright, let’s keep it under control tonight.<br>
Tuesday, yep, no excuse to drink more than a couple.<br>
…Eh, a few.</i>
</p><p><i>
Goodness that music is loud.<br>
Are those women naked?
</i></p><p>
These art shows are kinda strange sometimes.<br>
Weirder yet is how comfortable and hidden I feel the weirder it gets.
</p><p>
I’ve never been able to articulate why I feel most comfortable in the chaos.<br>
In the edgy.<br>
In the weird.<br>
I sometimes think that it’s because the weirder, louder, busier it is, the more I am just a face in the crowd.<br>
It’s something like that.
</p><p>
I guess the better question is, who the hell am I hiding from?<br>
It’s like I want to be seen but not recognized.<br>
Hm.
</p><p>
Sip.<br>
<i>Man, that’s good.<br>
Ahhhh that’s nice.<br>
Okay, where are my people?</i>
</p><p>
I check my phone to see if anyone else is here yet.<br>
Nothing.<br>
Just a digital clock staring me in the face saying, “Nope, no friends here. Try harder.”
</p><p>
Slipping the phone back into my pocket, I continue browsing the gallery.<br>
Admiring the art.<br>
Making small talk with the artists.<br>
Asking myself why this couldn’t be me.
</p><p><i>
Do they know me?<br>
Keep walking, don’t look suspicious.<br>
Man, I’d love to live this life.<br>
These are the people bringing us back to reality.
</p><p>
I wonder what inspires these people?
Look at that.
Wait, is that a…
Yeah. Has to be.
</i></p><p>
An intense vibration in my pants breaks me out of the mental monologue.<br>
Realizing it’s my phone buzzing, I reach for my pocket.
</p><p>
<i>Thank God, a reason to look busy.</i><br>
A text from Jackie. They’re on the 3rd floor.<br>
<i>There are three floors?<br>
How many drinks have you had, man? 
</i></p><p>
I started to make my way to the corner where the fashion artists were.<br>
Human art or something like that.<br>
The art with people dressed up and painted in exotic dress.<br>
<i>I am pretty sure these people are not wearing clothes.<br>
Look or don’t look.<br>
Look or don’t look.<br>
Ah, what the heck, I’ve had a drink.<br>
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol.
</i></p><p>
Very primal.<br>
Very real.<br>
The artists are here.<br>
They’re in the moment.<br>
Like an actor on stage.<br>
Or musician behind the mic.<br>
This is their ultimate expression.<br>
This is their gift to the world.
</p><p><i>
I wonder what these people see.<br> 
Do people look at them differently?<br>
I wonder what it feels like. 
</p><p>
A chance to let your guard down and be art, not human.<br>
What a world that would be.<br>
Being relieved of your humanity, even if just for a second. 
</p></i><p>
Realizing I’ve been lost in thought for the past 5 minutes while staring at painted, naked people, I snap back to the moment and keep walking.
</p><p>
Eventually finding the stairs, I inevitably bump into an old co-worker.<br>
<i>Shit, shit, shit.</i><br>
“Hey Sam, how are you?” I jump in with both feet.<br>
We all have a game face.<br>
We just put it on for different situations.
</p><p>
Pleasantries are exchanged.<br>
Then we both get over ourselves and go back to the night.<br>
Up the stairs, I climb.
</p><p>
This music though.<br>
Woah this is real.
</p><p>
Sip.<br>
<i>Crap. Gonna need a refill.</i>
</p><p>
As I emerge to the 3rd floor, I look up from the last step and there she is.<br>
The one person in this city, I can’t help but see.
</p><p>
