<h1>You Don’t Own Your Business</h1>
<small>October 11, 2018</small>
</header>

<p>
I used to think I was a business owner, and I’ll be honest, it was cool as hell.
</p><p>
(Currently realizing how little sense that expression makes)
</p><p>
In 2017 I started a business with 3 co-founders, we capitalized it, divvied up responsibilities, and got started.<br>
Shortly after, we landed our first customer and cashed our first check.
</p><p>
BAM! I was a business owner.
</p><p>
Right?
</p><p>
Wrong.
</p><p>
It took me about a year and a half to finally realize that I didn’t own my business, I was my business.<br>
And I never really would have understood the contrast had it not been for the events of this past month.
</p><p>
What was the catalyst, you might ask?
</p><p>
Well, two things happened.
</p><p>
First, one of my advisors made a pretty point blank statement and left little room for misunderstanding.<br>
It went something like,<br>
“Seth, you are your business.<br>
Your business is Seth!<br>
Seth is Periwinkle!<br>
Periwinkle is Seth!<br>
You are your business!”
</p><p>
Oh…
</p><p>
I am a state school graduate with a 3.45 GPA, so I was able to catch on pretty quick.<br>
I was my business.<br>
Me and my business were two in the same.<br>
Makes sense.<br>
I got it!
</p><p>
Yeah, I’d like to say I am that smart and quick to catch on, but when’s the last time you took one person’s opinion and accepted it as law?
</p><p>
Luckily for me, there was a second punch coming.
</p><p>
Exactly 2 weeks later, I was on a call with an investor discussing a challenge our business was facing and he said,<br> 
“Hey I didn’t invest in your business, I invested in you.<br>
I don’t give a shit about your business, I am betting on you.<br> 
I think you can find a way to make this work.<br>
I would have never invested in your business alone.”
</p><p>
Some might be wanting to caution me on this investor now, but I think he was just trying to make a point…<br>
I think.
</p><p>
Both a compliment and a slap in the face simultaneously.<br>
Ah… The life of entrepreneurship.
</p><p>
While he didn’t exactly say, “You are your business, and your business is you!”<br>
I think it’s fair to say that he was saying the exact same thing, just worded in a different way.
</p><p>
So what’s the takeaway?
</p><p>
Until you can go get on a sail boat and spend 6 months sailing around the world without a hiccup in your business, you <strong>are</strong> your business, you don’t own your business.
</p><p>
If you are still skeptical, then I’d say you’re pretty dang likely to be a successful entrepreneur.<br>
Why? Because you are unwilling to accept what people say without vetting it for yourself.<br>
More on this on my post about <a href="reject">rejecting the default</a>.<br>
And I’d also point you to a book that may help prove my point.<br>
It’s not the easiest read in the world, but it addresses a problem that should fascinate you if you play in this sandbox.
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280">The E-Myth Revisited by Michael Gerber</a><br>
This book is all about answering the question of why most small businesses fail and how to overcome the odds.
</p><p>
If you want your life to include building business and this book’s subtitle doesn’t fascinate you, then I’m not sure you know how much the odds are stacked against us.
</p><p>
We don’t own our business, our business owns us until the day that we hire someone to replace us and we sail off into the sunset with a cold margarita in hand.<br>
With this in mind, make sure you think twice before starting your 1st, 2nd, or 3rd business because it’s gonna need you to survive.
