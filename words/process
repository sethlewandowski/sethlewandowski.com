        It seems like most people are looking for the event that will make them rich, fit, or popular.
      </p><p>
        - Boost your monthly income by 10k in 10 days using this hack.<br>
        - The one food that turns your body into a fat burning machine.<br>
        - Here's how to get 100 new followers with one post.
      </p><p>
        Events, events, events.
      </p><p>
        Discover the secret, apply the secret, then forever experience your richer, fitter, and more popular self. 
      </p><p>
        Might I propose that all this nonsense is... just that - nonsense? 
      </p><p>
        Behind every rich, popular, and fit person is a solidified process, NOT an event that changed their life forever. 
      </p><p>
        I realize that what I am proposing is not at all a novel idea. Hell, what is these days though?
      </p><p>
        But consider for a moment all the ways in which you're searching for the event to fix your problems. 
      </p><p>
        - The dream vacation that rids you of your stress.<br>
        - The one big business deal that will make you rich forever.<br>
        - The dream house that will make you happier than ever before.<br>
        - The trophy husband that will make all your friends jealous.
      </p><p>
        Life is not events. Life is process.
      </p><p>
        Financial well-being does not come from events. It doesn't happen when you buy a Dave Ramsey program.
      </p><p>
        It comes from establishing a system and sticking with it.
      </p><p>
        It's not totally your fault though. 
      </p><p>
        The deck has been stacked against you. 
      </p><p>
        You see, process doesn't sell. 
      </p><p>
        The story of hard work and persistence doesn't pack a auditorium full of thousands of people or make your book a best seller. 
      </p><p>
        You don't want to hear about the years and years of grinding it out as a bartender before (insert famous moviestar here) made it big and got on the bigscreen.
      </p><p>
        Nope, what you want to hear about is the one book that Steve Jobs read that changed his life forever.
      </p><p>
        Or the one stock that Warren Buffet recommends to add to your portfolio. 
      </p><p>
        We all want the secret. The secret event that will bring us our deepest desires. 
      </p><p>
        But let us not forget that it's the process that leads to wealth, health, and fame. Never the event.
      </p><p>
        And don't confuse someone's "big break" with an event. There was usually years of process that led to the "big break". Not the $100 spent dialing a number on the back of Entrepreneur magazine. 
      </p><p>
        Next time you're trying to fix something in your life, whether it be your happiness, health, wealth, or relationships, consider the solution to your problems may be better solved by implementing a process and sticking with it rather than searching tirelessly for the event that will fix your problem overnight. 
      </p><p>
        The irony is, that event being sold to you is usually part of someone else's process to get what they desire.

        This post is inspired by one of my favorite books <a href="https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B004BDOUAI&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_3FwrEbAY42E9H">The Millionaire Fastlane by M.J. Demarco</a>. I highly recommend it to anyone who can get past the title. Maybe just read this one in private or my personal favortie - <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Millionaire-Fastlane-Crack-the-Code-to-Wealth-and-Live-Rich-for-a-Lifetime-Audiobook/B0143BEDUO?qid=1581607045&sr=1-1&pf_rd_p=e81b7c27-6880-467a-b5a7-13cef5d729fe&pf_rd_r=ZMR4G885EE7QMQ5ZKH2R&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1">listen to it on audible</a> as the author narrates the entire book.
