<h1>What Are You Going to Do?</h1>

<p>
It’s easy to feel like we can’t escape.<br>
Especially when we reside in the town we grew up.<br>
Everyone knows you.<br>
You know everyone.
</p><p>
Gotta get something at Whole Foods?<br>
You’re gonna bump into someone from work.<br>
Want to take a date to KEO?<br>
You’re gonna be spotted by your uncles best friend.
</p><p>
This really puts people out sometimes.<br>
Gets them all wound up.<br>
Like a top, ready to pop.
</p><p>
Have that friend that wears a hat and sunglasses everywhere?<br>
With the hopes that they will avoid that awkward, familiar glare?
</p><p>
I have that friend.<br> 
And often times, I am that friend.
</p><p>
But what about online?<br> 
Funny how people stay quiet for this very reason.
</p><p>
Oh, what will people think about my photos?<br> 
What will they say about my writing?<br>
I feel the draw.<br>
But the fear, oh God the fear.
</p><p>
Want to play a fun game called Vulnerability?<br>
Create something and put it out there on your social feed.
</p><p>
I get it.<br>
I’m with you.<br>
The transition from consumer to producer sucks.<br>
Especially when you’re just getting started,<br>
And you’re still giving too many ****s.
</p><p>
It’s easier for some.<br>
It’s easier for those who already wrote blending in off.<br> 
But what about you?<br>
Is it wrong to still want to blend in and stick with your crew like glue?
</p><p>
No, it’s not.<br>
That’s totally fine.<br> 
But it will be up to you now.<br> 
To figure out how.
</p><p>
The real question is simple.<br>
Is it worth taking to the grave,<br>
Your true gift that has the power to save?
</p><p>
Blah blah blah, Seth.<br>
It’s just words on a page.<br> 
Who reads this shit anyway?<br>
You’ll never make the stage.
</p><p>
We all have this friend inside our head.<br> 
Telling us how it really is.<br>
Stomping out the “What if’s?”<br>
Stomping out the “How can I’s?”
</p><p>
A lot of people feel like they weren’t born with the “Gift”.<br> 
People believe that some have it and some don’t.
</p><p>
To this, I call, B.S.<br> 
It’s just another excuse you’ve given yourself.<br> 
I bet it’s just one of many on your list.<br> 
As you sit there, clenching your fist.
</p><p>
What if you could help just one person?<br>
What if your expression inspired the next Elvis?<br> 
Would it be worth it?<br>
…
</p><p>
My point here is, ask yourself what urge you’ve been stifling?<br> 
What push you’ve resisted, what push you’ve been fighting.<br>
Ask yourself if it’s really worth it.<br>
Is it worth it?
</p><p>
Someone out there is waiting to be inspired by you.<br> 
The real question is –<br>
What are you going to do? 
</p>
