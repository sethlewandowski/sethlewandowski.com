<p>
It’s a weird feeling.<br>
Writing.<br>
Writing when you know no one is reading.
</p><p>
Blah blah blah, I guess it really is just words on a page.<br>
But these words are far, far too many people’s.<br>
One and only stage.
</p><p>
And yeah, I know you’ve heard it all before.<br>
I know you’re wondering where this is all going.
</p><p>
They say that the two most powerful weapons in the world are the human mouth and the computer keyboard.<br>
Yet, somehow,<br>
Even with both of those weapons,<br>
I don’t exactly feel dangerous.<br>
I don’t exactly feel powerful.
</p><p>
Maybe the takeaway is that what we say matters a whole lot more than we think?
</p><p>
You are probably asking yourself:<br>
“What the heck is this guy talking about?”
</p><p>
You’re probably wondering:<br>
What is he getting at?
</p><p>
I guess my question is:<br>
“When’s the last time you had the courage to step up and swing the bat?”
</p><p>
You know what I’m talking about.<br>
You know the feeling.
</p><p>
You know you’re supposed to tell someone that you love them.<br>
But can’t quite get yourself singing.
</p><p>
You know you’re supposed to thank someone for what they said.<br>
But the fear sets in and you stay in bed.
</p><p>
They say we are supposed to express ourselves creatively.<br> 
But to that, I say, why does it feel so hard to open yourself up?<br>
To surrender your pride and ego, and trust the world so faithfully?
</p><p>
Damn this kid is all over the place.<br>
Do you think he just needs more space?
</p><p>
I don’t need more space.<br>
But yeah, I guess I am still trying to find my place.
</p><p>
Que the music.<br>
Que the mic drop.<br>
Grab that Veuve Clicquot bottle and give it a pop.
</p><p>
A different flow.<br>
A different sound.<br>
Man, I can really feel my heart starting to pound.
</p><p>
Some say I’m deep.<br>
Some say I’m complex.<br>
Kinda like trying to figure out why you can never find any decent Tex-Mex.
</p><p>
Wow Seth, you’re really forcing these flows.<br>
Don’t you wanna sit down man, don’t you wanna just wait for some better prose?
</p><p>
I’ve been asking myself the same exact question.<br>
So, yes, and thanks for the unsolicited attention.
</p><p>
The funny thing about this game is.<br>
We are all given the same twenty-six.<br>
It’s just up to each one of us to figure out how to come up with <strong>The Best Mix.</strong>
