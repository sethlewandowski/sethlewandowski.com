<h1>How to Overcome Procrastination</h1>

<p>
Why is it that when we want to accomplish something big and important to us, we find it very difficult to do so?
</p><p>
The Answer: <strong>Procrastination.</strong>
</p><p>
Procrastination is simply the human response to resistance. <br>
And it's something that we all struggle with.<br>
Regardless of how "accomplished", "disciplined", or "successful" we are.
</p><p>
And what sucks is, the bigger the apple and the more we want something, the harder it is to overcome the resistance. 
</p><p>
This is not a new idea. 
There are books on this topic alone. 
</p><p>
But damn, if we're having trouble getting our butts outside to go exercise, we probably aren't hitting up amazon to order and read books. 
</p><p>
So perhaps this web page is our only hope? 
</p><p>
Well, I sure hope not. 
</p><h4>
The reason resistance kicks us in the butt is because we are too lazy to get specific.
</h4><p>
We don't get specific about what we want.<br>
Nope, we use nebulous terms like "successful", "rich", or "happy".
</p><p>
We don't get specific about what it is going to take to accomplish something.<br>
Our goals are left as 
<ul>
  <li>"Become a web developer"</li>
  <li>"Get a new job".</li>
  <li>"Build a new house".</li>
</ul>
<p>
And if it can't be accomplished in a day, we just don't do it. 
</p><p>
These things just don't happen. 
</p><p>
When procrastination is overcoming us, it's because we haven't gotten <strong>specific</strong> about what we want and how we are going to get there.<br>
It takes a lot of effort actually to decide on these things. 
</p><p>
<dl>
  <dt>It's so much easier to have the goal</dt>
    <dd>"Have a successful blog"</dd>
  <dt>Than it is to have the goal</dt>
    <dd>"Publish a blog post every week".</dd>
</dl>
</p><p>
So we remain comfortable in our misery. <br>
Like a donkey who can't decide whether it wants to eat some hay or drink some water first. <br>
For anyone not familiar with this little anecdote, I'll spoil the ending.<br>
The donkey dies of starvation.
</p>
<p>
  ... I'm guessing most of us probably don't want to be the donkey in that story.
</p>
<h2>
Here Are 3 Steps to Overcoming Procrastination
</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Decide What We Want</h3>
      <p>None of this works without first deciding what we actually want.</p>
      <p>Is it a job?<br>
        Girlfriend?<br>
        Spouse?<br>
        New Car?<br>
        Better friends?
      </p>
      <p>And when we are having trouble coming up with our list of "wants", all we need to do is jump on Instagram for 5 minutes and realize how terrible our lives are compared to everyone else's.</p>
      <p>And now we have our list of wants.</p>
      <p>Queue golf clap. We've graduated to step 2.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Make it Measurable</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>It's much easier to:</dt>
        <dd>"Want to be rich"</dd>
        <dt>Than it is to:</dt>
        <dd>"Want $50,000 in the bank".</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>The ambiguity gives us the "out" we are looking for.</p>
      <p>But when we are serious about overcoming procrastination, we are forced to swallow the fear and get specific.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How many new friends?</li>
        <li>What kind of a spouse?</li>
        <li>How much savings?</li>
        <li>What kind of a new job and paying how much?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Don't let the specifics scare you, let them liberate you.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Make it Achievable</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Do you want to know why people don't eat hamburgers in one bite?</dt>
        <dd>Because it's simply not possible.</dd>
        <dt>Do you want to know why we fail to accomplish the big things we dream of?</dt>
        <dd>Because they simply aren't possible in their whole form.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>The funny thing is, we all know this truth, but we don't use it to our advantage.</p>
      <strong>If we can't do something to move us closer to our goal in about an hour of effort, then the bite is too big.</strong>
      <p>In fact, I find that if we don't break our bites down into things that can be accomplished in 5 minutes, the bite is usually too big.</p>
      <p>When we care about our dream enough to break it down into bite sized pieces, we can accomplish anything.</p>
      <p>People don't get to where they are by chance, but by careful planning and execution.</p>
      <p>This is true for sports teams, companies, marriages, and mountains summited.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>How Can We Overcome Procrastination?</h2>
<p>Easy - Set ourselves up for success by getting a knife and fork out and cutting that steak into bite sized pieces.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Define the goal.</dt>
  <dd>(The "What?")</dd>
  <dt>Get specific about it</dt>
  <dd>(The "What Kind?")</dd>
  <dt>Then break it down into bite sized pieces.</dt>
  <dd>(The "How?")</dd>
</dl>

<p>Use this model to go chase and accomplish your dreams.</p>
<p>Godspeed.</p>
