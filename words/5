<h1>5 Minutes</h1>
<small>July 21, 2020</small>
</header>
<main>
We all have 5 minutes.<br>
We might not have an hour. Or even half an hour.<br>
But we all have 5 minutes.
</p><p>
And 5 minutes is actually all it takes to accomplish anything.<br>
Be it health goals, wealth goals, or career goals.
</p><p>
The real problem is not a lack of time.<br>
It's a lack of deconstruction.
</p><p>
When we don't deconstruct our goals into their individual parts, we don't take action because the steps are too big.<br>
Too time consuming<br>
Too difficult.
</p><p>
"I don't even know where to begin!"<br>
"I don't have time."<br>
"I just can't today."<br>
We've all been guilty of using these excuses to justify our inaction.
</p><p>
The greatest change, creation, and discovery our world has ever seen was just a series of 5 minute bursts of effort.<br>
Isn't the Sistine Chapel just a sequence of small focused brush strokes?
</p>
<hr>
<p>
5 minutes is enough to change the course of one life forever.<br>
And one life can change the course of humanity forever.<br>
So I guess that means that 5 minutes can change the world, right?
</p>
<p>
I guess the real question is, what will you do with your 5 minutes today?
