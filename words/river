      <h1>The River</h1>

<p>
I'll be honest with you.<br>
I like being in the river. <br>
It's fast. Exciting. Even fun. <br>
But sometimes I start to forget why I got in the river in the first place. 
</p><p>
So, I get out.<br>
I swim to shore, sit down, and take a deep breath.<br>
I look down at the sand that sticks to my feet.<br>
The footprints leading away from the shore.<br>
Everything is still.<br>
Yet, the river keeps rushing on.
</p><p>
Sure, some people will pass me.<br>
But that's okay.<br>
There might even be some people that snicker at me for getting out.<br>
But that's okay too.
</p><p>
What they don't know is, I'm not competing with them anymore.
</p>
<p>
I realized that I had opted in to a game that I didn't even like playing.
</p><p>
Maybe it was the grading system in school.<br>
A's, B's, C's.<br>
GPA's.<br>
ACT's.
</p><p>
Maybe it was the rankings in sports.<br>
First string.<br>
First chair.<br>
D1, D2.<br>
Full ride this. Full ride that.<br>
Whatever it is, it's just easier to join in on an existing game than to come up with your own. 
</p><p>
What they don't know is, I'm not sitting on the shore because I need a break.<br>
I'm not doing it because I'm out of breath or because I'm cramping.
</p><p>
I'm sitting on the shore because, after a while, I start to forget <i>why</i> I got in the river in the first place.
</p><p>
By pulling myself out of the race and out of the frenzy, I'm able to ask myself:<br>
<strong>Is what I'm going after still what I want?</strong><br>
What I need?<br>
Or what I'm suppose to be doing?
</p><p>
I'm able to assess whether my current route and pace is serving not only myself, but also those I love, and those that love me.<br>
I'm able to assess whether what I'm doing is making a difference.<br>
Moving the needle.
</p><p>
You see, the biggest failure for me is not finishing in the "middle of the pack" of someone else's game.<br>
The biggest failure for me is forgetting why I'm swimming in the first place and losing myself in the competition.<br>
It's waking up at 50 years old and realizing that I've been asleep at the wheel for the last 30 years.
</p><p>
So, I might end up deciding to walk over to a different river and see what's going on over there.<br>
Or, I might decide to just sit for a bit and enjoy the calm.<br>
The still.<br>
Eventually, I might even decide to just get back in and keep going. 
</p><p>
The irony is, usually the hardest thing to do is to get out of the river and sit.
