Doug:<br>
“Okay, so we’ve got a good thing going.<br>
People love us.<br>
Sales are up.<br>
Profits are up.<br>
But how do we go from a successful small business to a global brand?”
</p><p>
Ron:<br>
“I read an article last week talking about how parents want to go eat at places where their kids are excited to eat.<br>
Places where their kids will eat with a smile on their face.<br>
How can we make our establishment appeal to children?”
</p><p>
“Kids like sweet stuff right?<br>
What if we added sweeteners to all our sauces and included them in the meals for kids?”
</p><p>
“Oh… Yeah…<br>
That’s good, that’s good.<br>
Oh! I’ve got a crazy idea!<br>
Kids go absolutely nuts for Christmas, right?<br>
Why?”
</p><p>
“Uh… Because of Christmas lights and Santa?”
</p><p>
“Toys.<br>
Toy companies live and breathe off of Christmas season.<br>
What if we literally gave kids toys when they came to eat here?<br>
It’ll be like Christmas morning every day.”
</p><p>
“Oh come on, Ron.<br>
We aren’t Toy’s “R” Us!”
</p><p>
“Doug, stay with me here.<br>
We both agree that in order to grow, we need to win the children.<br>
What do kids love? They love candy and they love toys.<br>
We don’t have to serve candy. We aren’t MARS Corp.<br>
But we can mimic candy by engineering our food to look like healthy food but taste like candy.<br>
And we can give kids a toy every time they come to eat here.<br>
So, sure we might lose money or even break even on the kids, but if we get the kids we get the parents.<br>
Kids’ cant drive here on their own.
</p><p>
“And guess what, Ron? Kids become parents.<br>
If we win the customer as a kid, we win them for their entire life.”
</p><p>
“Talk about a high customer lifetime value! Hahahaha”
</p><p>
“This is perfect.<br>
The board will go bananas for this.”
</p><p>
“Wait a minute.”
</p><p>
“What? What’s wrong?”
</p><p>
“You know that theory about why our store in the central valley is the most profitable?”
</p><p>
“The one with the playground down the street?”
</p><p>
“That’s the one!”
</p><p>
“Okay, what about it?”
</p><p>
“What if that marketing researcher is correct?<br>
What if it is the most profitable because of the playground down the street?”
</p><p>
“I don’t know. We start picking locations that have parks nearby?”
</p><p>
“Doug, we start building our own playgrounds attached to the freaking building.<br>
Inside the building, Doug!”
</p><p>
“Hooooooollllllllllyyyyyyy Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!”
</p><p>
“You with me here?”
</p><p>
“You’re saying, we hit kids with the trifecta?<br>
Sweet tasting food disguised as healthy food, a toy with every meal, and a freaking playground inside every single location?”
</p><p>
A large smile rolls across Ron’s face.
</p><p>
“Holy shit, Ron.<br>
You know if this works, we will become the biggest franchise of all time, right?<br>
You and I will become multi-millionaires?”
</p><p>
“Doug, if you win the customer as a kid, you win their parents until they can drive, then you win them through adulthood, and you win their kids when they start families.<br>
If you win the kids, you win. Forever.<br>
It’s a flywheel.”
</p><p>
“We gotta present this to the board.<br>
They’re going to love it.<br>
Ron, if this works, this will change our industry, no, our country forever.”
</p><p>
“If this works, you and I can quit our jobs and go sit on a beach somewhere.”
</p><p>
“I’m in. Let’s pitch it on Monday.”
