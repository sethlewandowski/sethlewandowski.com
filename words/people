<h1>We Are In The Business Of People</h1>
<small>October 22, 2018</small>

<p>
How many times have you made an investment of $0 and had a massive return?
</p><p>
Well, never.<br>
This probably has never happened.<br> 
Okay, maybe 1 in a million?<br>
<i>So you’re telling me there’s a chance?</i>
</p><p>
How can we expect big results, big businesses, and big outcomes from people when we don’t show our expectations through catering to their priorities?
</p><p>
As much as we entrepreneurs would like to think we fall outside the box.<br> 
We like to think we are different.<br> 
A different breed of people.<br> 
Aliens from another universe.
</p><p>
The truth is, we fall prey to the same biological programming as our earthling counterparts.<br> 
Incentives.<br> 
We are susceptible to incentives too.<br> 
Our priorities may be different, sure.<br> 
But our incentives are the same.
</p><p>
Entrepreneurs are in it for the long term.<br> 
We leave the cushy W-2 world and opt for a different life.<br> 
One usually with no benefits.<br> 
And if there are benefits, guess who’s paying for them?<br> 
A small salary, if you’re lucky.<br>
Mostly solo, self-dictated work.<br> 
Back to our conversation about kissing the feeling of accomplishment goodbye.<br> 
But holy moly.<br> 
The upside.<br> 
The percentages on the cap table.<br> 
It’s all just numbers.<br> 
But we trade the high W-2 in.<br> 
And, in exchange, get a high % on an excel spreadsheet.
</p><p>
We all respond to incentives.<br> 
But our priorities and preferences are different.
</p><p>
This calls to question whether we entrepreneurs make the mistake of focusing on incentives and not priorities.<br> 
Is it possible the priorities of your co-founders are different than yours?<br> 
You are all entrepreneurs though, so they should be the same priorities right?<br> 
Wrong.<br> 
But Seth, how do you know?<br> 
Because I make these mistakes and learn the hard way.<br> 
Then I sit down in a hotel lobby and write about them.<br>
Why?<br>
I don’t know. I just do it.<br> 
Yes but why do you do it?<br> 
Same reason people do most things.<br> 
Because it feels good.<br>
Because I like it.<br>
Because it feels natural.
</p><p>
Your co-founders have the same incentives as you.<br>
Whether that be making money or contributing to this world, for example.<br>
However, they do NOT have the same priorities as you.<br>
One of them wants cash in the door ASAP.<br>
One of them wants flexibility in their work schedule.<br>
The other is still trying to pay down school debt.<br>
One of them just wants out of their day job.
</p><p>
Most adolescent entrepreneurs (age in entrepreneurship not age in years) think they are in the business of business.<br>
They create cool stuff and sell it to people.<br>
It’s all systems and numbers.<br>
You’d be right in thinking that.<br>
But you’d be 100% wrong.<br>
You’d be wrong because entrepreneurs are in the people business.<br>
Businesses don’t buy widgets.<br>
People do.<br>
Businesses don’t sign up for subscriptions.<br>
People do.<br>
Businesses don’t buy other businesses.<br>
People do.<br>
Businesses don’t grow their own business.<br>
People do.<br>
Businesses don’t hire 1,000 people in a year.<br>
People do.<br>
Businesses aren’t businesses.<br>
People are businesses.
</p><p>
But I work in tech and it’s different for me!<br>
Is it?<br>
How many employees does Facebook have?<br>
Google have?<br>
Uber have?<br>
Airbnb have?<br>
Amazon have?
</p><p>
We are in the people business, people.<br>
It’s best we start pulling our heads out of our asses and start operating with that in mind.
</p><p>
And I’m talking about pulling my own head out of my own [you know].<br>
I’m not calling you out.<br>
But chances are, you’ve been there too.<br>
Unless you’re the greatest entrepreneur ever and have never made mistakes.<br>
And if that’s the case, you’re reading the wrong blog post right now.<br>
You should be sipping a skinny margarita on your island watching the waves crash into the beach.
</p><p>
But for the rest of us, know you’re not alone.
</p><p>
Life kinda feels like a game sometimes doesn’t it?<br>
Like a simulation?<br>
Uh oh, here we go.<br>
No, I’m not going there today.<br>
Maybe one day.
</p><p>
It’s a game of levers and pulleys.<br> 
Entrepreneurship is like being on a sailboat in a hurricane.<br>
It’s pouring rain and you’re facing 100+ foot waves.<br>
Your team is soaking wet.<br>
Can’t see a thing.<br>
Trying to fix the mast.<br> 
You’re running around.<br>
Trying to help your team.<br>
Coach them.<br>
Fix the boat.<br>
Steer the boat.<br>
Pray to God you’ll survive.
</p><p>
You can come up with cool ideas and get a MVP out there till the cows come home.<br>
But until you start to take seriously the idea that building businesses is more about people than it is about business, you’re never going to scale in a meaningful way.
</p><p>
We are in the business of people.<br>
Not the business of business.
</p><p>
I share this because I didn’t really understand this distinction until last week when someone metaphorically reached across the conference table and slapped me open-handed as hard as they could.<br>
Shout out to you, Jacob J.
</p><p>
I guess what I am really trying to say is this.<br>
If you’re getting into entrepreneurship because you think you can sit alone in a room and build cool stuff and change the world, you’re wrong.<br>
I fell prey to the misunderstanding too.<br>
So don’t be so hard on yourself.<br>
Entrepreneurs must be people experts.<br>
People are your customers.<br>
People are your investors.<br>
People are your employees.<br>
People are your business partners.<br>
People are your fans.<br>
People are your tech support.<br>
People are your business.<br>
And you are in the business of people.
</p><p>
Find out what the priorities of all the above people are and meet those priorities.
</p><p>
If you can do that.<br>
You will have happy, motivated customers.<br>
Happy, motivated employees.<br>
Happy, motivated investors.<br>
Happy, motivated business partners.<br>
Happy, motivated trade partners.<br>
Happy, motivated fans.
</p><p>
And once you have that.<br>
You may even end up with a happy, motivated buyer.
</p><p>
And once you have that.<br>
You may even end up with an island of your own.
</p><p>
And once you have that.<br>
You’ll hopefully be a happy, motivated person wanting to go do it all over again.
