<h1>A New System</h1>
<small>November 12, 2018</small>
</header>

<p>
There’s a theory that I’ve come to hold fairly close.<br>
And they say it takes one to know one.<br>
It takes someone who stifled their creativity to know one.<br>
It takes someone who chased the money and title to know one.<br>
It takes someone who tried to be someone they weren’t to know one. 
</p><p>
But it’s a delicate balance you know?<br>
We are fighting two instincts.<br>
Two, conflicting survival instincts.<br> 
The instinct to blend in.<br>
To fit in.<br>
And the instinct to create, build, and change. 
</p><p>
But our world rewards and praises people that fit into the system.<br>
The people that perform well on standardized tests.<br>
The left brain types. 
</p><p>
It’s a viscous cycle.<br>
Get good grades in primary school.<br>
Study hard for the ACT/SAT.<br>
Get into a good college.<br>
Get good grades in college.<br>
Get a good job.<br>
Seek more money & promotions until you’re 65.<br>
Then go enjoy your life!<br>
You deserve it now! 
</p><p>
But like I said, it takes one to know one.<br>
It takes someone who fell into this cycle to know how self defeating it is for the wrong person.<br>
This system actually is a great fit for some. 
</p><p>
My brother is a good example. 
</p><p>
He’s the smartest person that I know.<br>
And he has a big heart.<br>
So it sounds like I am saying he’s flawed or misguided by pointing out how well he’s done in the system.<br>
But that’s not what I am saying at all.<br>
I am saying that the system isn’t for everyone.<br>
Just like vanilla ice cream.<br>
(I’m on day 6 of a no-sugar-added fast and all I can think about is vanilla ice cream)<br>
People like my brother are incredibly important and incredibly gifted individuals.<br>
They are the unicorns of this world just like envious startup founders.<br>
We need them.<br>
They need us.<br>
It’s all the same. 
</p><p>
But take my sister for example. 
</p><p>
My sister is also an incredible person.<br>
But she’s the complete opposite of my brother.<br>
My sister and her experience trying to fit into the education/career cycle of today is the problem I am talking about here.<br>
My sister will find a way to make a big difference in this world.<br>
But it will take her longer to do so.
</p><p>
That’s because the path that matches my brothers’ gifts is clearly laid out.<br>
The path that matches my sisters’ is about as clear as mud. 
</p><p>
I look around this world and see a constant battle in people’s eyes.<br>
People trying to be someone they aren’t.<br>
People eating themselves to death.<br>
Drinking themselves to death.<br>
Destroying their lives trying to cope with the pain of attempting to fit into a system they were never made to.<br>
Not everyone, but enough to catch my eye.<br>
Enough to know I’m not alone.
</p><p>
It’s a survival mechanism.<br>
Don’t fight the tide.<br>
Swim with it.<br>
Find a way to enjoy your job.<br>
Keep looking for a church.<br>
That one just isn’t right for you.<br>
You’re in a different season. 
</p><p>
Go out and party with people your age, it’s weird to want to read on a Saturday night.<br> 
It’s funny that as I write this, I’m about to be kicked out of my apartment to make room for a batch of 50 artists being brought in from all over the world to create art in my city.<br> 
One of the key efforts to revitalizing and growing my downtown area is bringing art to it.<br> 
Not hot companies.<br>
Not music festivals.
</p><p>
Art. 
</p><p>
Let me rephrase because I hate the word “Art”.<br>
Somewhere in elementary school, I learned to hate the word.<br>
“Today we are going to learn how to draw a face.”<br>
“Trace these lines and color in and you’re an artist!”<br>
If there’s one thing I know it’s that this world needs more cookie cutter artists coming out of school.
</p><p>
That’s sarcasm if you didn’t catch it. 
</p><p>
I have a belief that I am starting to really embody.<br>
The belief is that <strong>we are a world full of creators who haven’t fit into the system.</strong><br>
It didn’t work in high school.<br>
It didn’t work in college.<br>
And most of us gave in and picked a career that wasn’t us.<br>
Isn’t us.<br>
And the rest are left to muck and fight through life trying to succeed in a world not set up for them. 
</p><p>
I wonder what this world would be like with a stronger infrastructure for creation.<br>
Better platforms for the right brained.<br>
Sure we have them, one could argue.<br>
But they aren’t democratized.<br>
The power is held by one or two people making the decision of what goes into the museum, magazine, newspaper, bookstore. 
</p><p>
I can’t help but think about how different our world could be, had the system been flipped. 
</p><p>
A system that caters to the right-brained.<br>
Where memorization wasn’t a guaranteed ticket to Harvard.<br>
Where abstract skillsets were the hottest commodity. 
</p><p>
But there’s the problem. How can you standardize the measurement of true creation? 
</p><p>
You can’t.<br>
People can’t.<br>
Sure as hell one teacher can’t.<br>
I’m not taking shots at educators.<br>
It’s not their fault they are asked to rank kids on an objective yardstick.<br>
They’re just doing their job. 
</p><p>
I’ve often thought that my purpose on this earth is to help my fellow creators.<br> 
To help build a platform, ungoverned by people who’ve succeeded in the system and become decision makers, guarding the gates into creation heaven.<br>
To give a person the ability to speak to the world.<br>
And God-willing, make a decent living doing so.<br>
Perhaps this is my purpose. 
</p><p>
I guess my point here is, my heart breaks for this world.<br>
For my fellow creators.<br>
It’s heartbreaking that creation has to be an elective.<br>
A hobby.<br>
A side hustle.<br>
A dream.<br>
Is there a better hammer that we can give our creative community?<br>
To build.<br>
To influence.<br>
To inspire.<br>
To share.<br>
To love.<br>
To grow? 
</p><p>
I believe there is.<br>
And I’ve set out to accomplish it.
