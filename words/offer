<h1>The Job Offer I'll Never Forget</h1>
<small>April 18, 2019</small>
</header>

<p>
It was a Monday just like all the others.
</p><p>
10:04 AM<br>
“Hey man, you have time to jump on a call today? I have an interesting opportunity that I want to run by you.”
</p><p>
Sure. Why not?
</p><p>
It was an email from my favorite mentor.
</p><p>
Going into it, I thought, “Maybe he’ll offer me an internship. Or maybe he’s looking for my 2 cents on something he perceives me having an important perspective on.”
</p><p>
Either way, I didn’t spend too much time thinking about it.<br>
Just figured he had something he wanted to chat about.
</p><p>
2:00 PM rolled around and I jumped on the call.<br>
It took me about 20 minutes to figure out what this call was all about.
</p><p>
Holy sh!t, this guy is about to offer me a job.
</p><p>
Honestly, I couldn’t believe it.
</p><p>
And some context here is important.
</p><p>
You see, I’m really interested in launching my next business in technology.<br>
And it’s not for the reasons you think.
</p><p>
“Oh, he just wants to be on the cover of Forbes!”<br>
“Oh, he just wants to make a bunch of money!”<br>
“He just wants to be famous!”
</p><p>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I’ve heard them all.<br>
Is that really all you got?<br>
Don’t hold back now.<br>
You have the protection of that computer screen.<br>
I can’t touch you.<br>
Say what you want.
</p><p>
The truth is, my first business was garage cleaning and organization and you never really understand the value in a distribution channel until you have a business that’s hard as [you know] to distribute.
</p><p>
So I’m on this call, realizing that one of the most important people in my life is wanting to hire me to do what I want to do for myself – Start and run a technology company.
</p><p>
This guy is entrusting me to help him build and operate a company with an expected exit around $25MM.
</p><p>
Talk about mind [you know], right?
</p><p>
I didn’t really have trouble coming to a decision, as hard as that might sound.<br>
Sure, this would double my income.<br>
And, yeah, this would put me in weekly contact with my favorite (non-family) mentor.<br>
(Take a deep breath, Mom!)<br>
Oh, also I would be able to learn the process of building tech in a virtually risk-free environment.
</p><p>
But the real thing I had the hardest time grappling with was that I finally realized that everyone around me believed I could do it,<br>
Except for me.
</p><p>
And this wasn’t the “Pat you on the back I believe you can do it!”
</p><p>
No, this was the, “Hey here’s $120,000 and equity, I think we can pull this off.<br>
Do you wanna come do this with me?”
</p><p>
Grrrr, [insert expletive here]
</p><p>
Yes, I did just e-growl. And no, it’s not a common thing.<br>
But it does feel pretty good so stay posted.
</p><p>
The decision that would normally take me about 5 seconds ended up taking about 48 hours to come to grips with.
</p><p>
When I told my dad, mom, aunt and uncle, best friend, and business partner about the opportunity, every single one of them said, “<strong>Take it</strong>.”
</p><p>
Every.<br>
Single.<br>
One.
</p><p>
My own business partner even told me to take the job knowing that I wouldn’t be as tied to success in our current business anymore.
</p><p>
And weirdly enough, by hearing the opposite of what I felt was right in my heart, I was assured that I was going in the right direction.
</p><p>
I wanted and needed everyone to tell me to do it.<br>
This was the only way I could feel at peace with my decision not to.<br>
And this probably goes back to my belief in the importance of <a href="reject"> 
  rejecting the default</a>.
</p><p>
Does any of this make sense?<br>
Hell no.
</p><p>
But nothing in life makes sense, nor is it fair.<br>
So if you’re looking for logic and reason go pick up a mathematics book from your local library and go away.
</p><p>
I’m somehow simultaneously flattered and haunted by that phone call.
</p><p>
They say that we can’t control what happens to us in life.<br>
We can only control how we perceive what happens to us in life.<br>
What it means to us.<br>
How we respond to it.
</p><p>
It took a phone call and money on the table for me to finally be convinced that I was fully capable of doing what I want to do.
</p><p>
And it’s sad that we can’t really trust our family and friends.<br>
They want to make us feel good.<br>
Tell us to follow our dreams.<br>
Encourage us regardless of the realities.
</p><p>
I guess what I am trying to say is, “<strong>What have you been waiting on external validation for?</strong>”
</p><p>
My girlfriend’s favorite artist has a song that says, “External validation is not a prerequisite for self-appreciation.”
</p><p>
In fact, I’ll go ahead and throw a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpY_BP2qe8c">link to that song</a> in case you’re feeling the vibes.
</p><p>
Monday, April 8th, 2019 I got a phone call that changed my life forever.
</p><p>
I’m hoping that you, unlike me, aren’t waiting for external validation before you decide you can actually follow your dreams.
