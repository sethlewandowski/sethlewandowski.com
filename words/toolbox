<h1>An Empty Tool Box</h1>

<p>
What if we are all just handymen walking around with a tool box?
</p>
<img src="../images/toolbox.jpg">
<p>
You see, we entrepreneurs are sensitive people.<br>
We are the artists of the business world.<br> 
Putting ourselves out there.<br>
Getting up on stage and showing the world our deep dark secrets.<br>
The things we've conjoured up in our minds.<br>
The problems in the world that we're tired of dealing with.
</p><p>
I used to think you either have it or you don't.<br>
Entrepreneurship isn't a tool in your tool box.<br>
You can't learn entrepreneurship.<br>
You either got it or you don't.
</p><p>
I've begun to frame this idea of entreprenurship in a different way.
</p>
<h2>My Old Understanding</h2>
<p>
You're either born with it or you're not.<br> 
Entrepreneurs are born, not created. <br>
Not built. Not taught.<br>
Born.<br>
You either have it or you don't.
</p><p>
Now, I still think part of this is true.<br>
Just like some people are born with the biology to be an olympic sprinter,<br>
Some people are born with the physiology to be an entrepreneur.<br>
But my understanding has evolved lately.
</p>
<h2>My New Understanding</h2>
<p>
You aren't really born an entreprenuer.<br>
You're born with some traits that make you more likely to move that direction.<br>
You're born a "handyman".<br>
You can do pretty much anything if you take the time to learn it.<br>
But you are born with an empty tool box.<br>
You only have the predisposition to be able to create, fix, build.
</p><p>
You are born with an empty tool box, and it's up to you to decide what kind of tools you want to put in your tool box.<br>
You can be the most knowledgeable handyman(entrepreneur) in the world.<br>
But if you show up to a broken house(problem) with an empty tool box(skills),<br>
You're ultimately useless.
</p><p>
How much value is there in knowing <strong>what</strong> to do?<br>
But not knowing <strong>how</strong> to do it?
</p><p>
Yes, a lot of entrepreneurship is having the courage to step out and take a risk.<br>
But how can you fix a broken house with an empty tool box?
</p>
<h3>Takeaway</h3>
<p>
If you haven't found your idea, calling, or passion yet,<br>
That's okay.<br>
Don't focus on that, because it will come.<br>
You can't force it.<br>
It's like trying to run fast while flexing every muscle in your body.<br>
Instead, focus on building skills and adding tools to your tool box.<br>
That way, when you finally find a house you want to work on,<br>
You're not showing up with <strong>an empty tool box</strong>.
