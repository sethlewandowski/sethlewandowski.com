Back here in the mix again.<br>
Finally sacked up and picked up that pen.<br>
It’s not worth doing unless you can hit that perfect ten.<br>
But how can you ever get there if you’re too scared to begin?
</p><p>
The flow starts to build with each word you write.<br> 
Up up and away, as you start to fly the kite.<br>
Truth is, it’s a brutal, nasty dogfight.<br>
A fight that most let brutally beat them, quietly, into the night.
</p><p>
But not you, nah, you stick with it like glue.<br> 
You even stuck with it last weekend when you had that nasty flu.<br> 
Truth is, you’re feeling inspired now, you’re feeling anew.<br>
Every word put down, moving you away from that winter blue.
</p><p>
The days come and the days go.<br>
Seemingly faster and faster, faster than ever before.<br> 
So time is ticking now, can't you feel it’s flow?<br>
Worse yet, how that colder wind continues to blow.
</p><p>
It’s worth trying to find that state.<br> 
Because once you do, you truly have a full plate.<br> 
Plus, let’s be honest, we both know it’s your inevitable fate.<br> 
Aren’t you ready to finally say, “Check mate?”
</p><p>
Okay moving on, moving on, what’s your point here anyway?<br>
My point is, find your flow and capture it, each and every day.
</p><p>
Oh, that’s sweet, you came up with a cute rhyme?!<br>
What’s next?! You gonna tell me everything will end up just fine?!
</p><p>
Hey, I don’t know who the heck let you in.<br>
But why don’t you go back where you belong – into that rubbish bin.
</p><p>
Fresh flow here, fresh flow there.<br> 
I thought Lululemon was the only threads you’d wear.<br> 
Okay now we are getting off point, so I’ll bring it back right now – I swear.
</p><p>
Take a look at my face, take a look into my eyes.<br> 
You think I’m playing? You think I’m dropping lies?<br> 
Let me set it straight for you, so you don’t keep mixing up the dyes.<br> 
This high I’m on, this flow I’ve found, you can never break the ties.
</p><p>
I’ll leave it here now, as the end is near.<br>
And no I ain’t quoting scripture, even though it might appear.
</p><p>
Tick tock tick tock, can you hear the clock?<br>
It’s time to open the door, can’t you hear the knock?
</p>
