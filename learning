    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>I'm not sure how useful my college education was. Nor am I sure how much I'll push my kids to go to college.</p>
    <p>I think there is far too much focus on "education" without much thought towards the science and skill of <strong>learning</strong>.</p>
    <p>This is my learning page if you're curious about what I've been learning lately. And if you're online, I'd encourage you to create a learning page as well. Education ends for all of us at some point, but that doesn't mean learning should.</p>

        <p>After being challenged a friend of mine, I decided to get a VPS and start self hosting everything. I decided to go with hostwinds and get an unmanaged vps for $4.99 a month.</p>
        <p>I installed Ubuntu and got my hands dirty. I probably spent a full 30 hours configuring this baby and, man, I learned a lot. This experience got me familiar with Ubuntu, UFW, SSH, Apache, and Nginx.</p>
