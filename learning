    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>I'm not sure how useful my college education was. Nor am I sure how much I'll push my kids to go to college.</p>
    <p>I think there is far too much focus on "education" without much thought towards the science and skill of <strong>learning</strong>.</p>
    <p>This is my learning page if you're curious about what I've been learning lately. And if you're online, I'd encourage you to create a learning page as well. Education ends for all of us at some point, but that doesn't mean learning should.</p>

        <h3>Out with the Node - In with the PHP</h3>
        <p>I swore that I would never touch PHP. When I started to learn how to code, I promised myself I would stay as focused as possible on as few languages/frameworks/technologies as possible.</p>
        <p>But, I realized this past weekend that using technology that works and let's you move faster isn't something to be ashamed of.</p>
        <p>I used to think that using CMS's was like buying your fish from a supermarket in a bass fishing competition. But it turns out, the longer I'm in this industry, the more I realize how nice it is to use something that just works and makes life easy.</p>
        <p>Could I have written a blog site from the ground up using node.js, express, ejs and front end languages? Sure.<br>
          Is it worth all that time and effort when I could use a free existing CMS and host it myself? No. Ultimately I decided it was not.</p>
        <p>So this past weekend, I completely changed my mind on building a clients blog on node and instead turned to the LEMP stack. Configuration was... a bit tricky. But honestly all in all it was considerably less time than I thought it was going to take.</p>

        <h3>Out with the Apache - In with the Nginx</h3>
        <p>I first learned some Apache when I was hosting my websites on Bluehost shared hosting. I had to know Apache and specifically .htaccess configurations in order to route requests to the correct domain (was hosting multiple domains). So, I assumed I should just keep using Apache for my VPS web server but after reading quite a lot of how-to articles on hosting a node.js app on a vps, I decided to switch to Nginx.</p>
        <p>The subtle irony here is I had an interview with Nginx 4 years ago and completely flunked it. I tried to do research and could not figure out what the company did or how to explain it. Funny now that I am a happy user.</p>

        <h3>A move to self hosting (virutally)</h3>
        <p>After being challenged a friend of mine, I decided to get a VPS and start self hosting everything. I decided to go with hostwinds and get an unmanaged vps for $4.99 a month.</p>
        <p>I installed Ubuntu and got my hands dirty. I probably spent a full 30 hours configuring this baby and, man, I learned a lot. This experience got me familiar with Ubuntu, UFW, SSH, and Apache.</p>
