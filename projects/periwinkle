    <h2 id="title">My First Website From Scratch</h2>
    <p>3 years ago, I thought it would be cool to start a business with my 3 best friends. I learned a TON of stuff from this experience and part of me wouldn't want to do it differently even if I could.</p>
    <p>As the only co-founder with any technology experience (I had built a squarespace website before), I took on the role of the "tech guy". It's been a long road, but it eventually led to me wanting to rebuild our business site from scratch. It was originally built with squarespace.</p>
