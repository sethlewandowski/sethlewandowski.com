          <dd>Wow, CSS can have variables! I didn't realize this until running through some simple challenges on freeCodeCamp.org. Since I've been doing websites for people, I've had many siuations where I've needed to mess around with all the h1, h2, and h3 font color's for example and had to change each one in the style sheet. So today, when I learned about CSS variables, I realized how obvious of a need this is and wondered why I hadn't researched it before. Anyway here's what I learned:
            <h2>CSS Variables</h2>
            <p>Instead of doing something like:<br>
              <code>
                h1 {
                  color: blue;
                }<br>
                h2 {
                  color: blue;
                }
              </code>
            </p>
            <p>You can do something like this:<br>
              <code>
                :root {
                  --header-color: blue;
                }<br>
                h1 {
                color: var(--header-color);
              }<br>
                h2 {
                color: var(--header-color);
              }
            </p></code>
            <p>This is an AMAZING feature. And I'm so surprised it took a year of coding for me to realize this. Now, it might mean nothing to most people, but I'm partial to doing static sites from scratch which means simplicity is king, especially when it comes to an ever growing style sheet.</p>
