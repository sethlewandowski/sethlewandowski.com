<h1>My First Script</h1>

<script>
  //First we initalize a variable with the user name input.  
  const visitorName = prompt("Hi, what is your name?");
  
  //Second we call the welcomeMessage function and pass in the visitorName variable as an argument. 
  welcomeMessage(visitorName);

  //This function is hoisted up to be used during the welcomeMessage function. 
  function welcomeMessage (visitorName) {
    document.write('Hello ' + visitorName + '!');
  }
</script>

<p>
  Yep, that's it. ^^^ One single line of text.<br>
  I know it's lame people. But it's better than null.

<h3>What happened exactly?</h3>
<p>I'm glad you asked.<br>
  Basically, I created a function that takes in a parameter "visitorName" that you (the visitor) provide me when the page loads.<br>
  I get this "visitorName" by creating a variable called "visitorName" and setting it equal to a javascript built in function called "prompt".<br>
  Once you provide your name in the prompt, I store that name in a variable called "visitorName".<br>
  Next, I call the function I created first with the argument "visitorName" that you provided me.<br>
  This function takes in the argument I provide it, and using the document.write() function, I print out "Hello + your name + !".<br>
  It's that simple.
</p><p>
  Crazy how much goes into such a simple task.<br> 
  I'm embarassed to say the entire thing took me over an hour.<br>
  Either way, that's my first offical script in the books people.<br>
  And it feels great to acutally DO something with all that knowledge rather than bang out drill after drill online.<br>
  On to bigger and better things. 
</p><h3>Here's the code:</h3>

<p><xmp>
<script>
  //First we initalize a variable with the user name input.  
  const visitorName = prompt("Hi, what is your name?");
  
  //Second we call the welcomeMessage function and pass in the visitorName variable as an argument. 
  welcomeMessage(visitorName);

  //This function is hoisted up to be used during the welcomeMessage function. 
  function welcomeMessage (visitorName) {
    document.write('Hello ' + visitorName + '!');
  }
</script>
</xmp>
</p>
<p>Notice this is an example of hoisting - a concept where a function defined later in your code is able to be used by a function earlier in your code. </p>
