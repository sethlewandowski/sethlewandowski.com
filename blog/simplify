        You've said it.<br>
        I've said it.<br>
        Your spouse has said it.<br>
        We've ALL said it, okay?!
      </p><h3>
        "I just didn't have time."
      </h3><p>
        As soon as you find yourself reaching for this excuse to justify your inability to spend time on the things you care about, STOP.
      </p><p>
        Stop everything. It's time to reasses. 
      </p>
      <h2>Simplify</h2>
      <p>
        My advice here is simple - <strong>simplify</strong>.
      </p><p>
        Simplify your life. 
      </p><p>
        Automate things that drain you, and free up time to dive deeper into the things that energize you.
      </p><p>
        If you don't care about clothing, why do you have 500 options in your closet that takes 20 minutes each morning to decide what to wear?<br>
        - Create a uniform, and free up time for something you care about. 
      </p><p>
        [One of the best decisions I've ever made is to give away all my casual clothing and buy one black pair of shorts, one black pair of jeans, and 5 black t-shirts. This is my uniform Monday - Friday no questions asked. I don't care about what I wear, so why was I spending precious decision making power on it?]
      </p><p>
        If you hate cooking, why are you buying random grocery items and forcing yourself to try to come up with ideas on what to cook?<br>
        - Find some simple receipes online and establish a routine. 
      </p><p>
        Monday is pasta night.<br>
        Tuesday is taco bowl night.<br>
        Wednesday is Salmon night.<br>
        You get the idea.
      </p><h2>
        Be Disciplined.
      </h2><p>
        Being disciplined about the things that drain our energy gives us the freedom to enjoy the things that give us energy.
      </p><p>
        We've all been sold on the lie that the more we have the happier we will be. 
      </p><p>
        This is, without question, a lie. 
      </p><p>
        A simple life is a beautiful life because a simple life provides the time to spend on the things you care about most. 
      </p><p>
        Automate things that drain you, dive deeper into the things that energize you.<br>
        Simplify, simplify, simplify.
      </p><p>
        This, my friends, is a big step towards fufillment and happiness in relationships, career, and personal projects. 
      </p><p>
        Simplify. 
      </p>
