<h1>We Bought a Story</h1>

<p>
Let me tell you a story.<br>
It’s a story about why we feel so empty.<br>
Take a look around.<br>
Who are we trying to please?<br>
The fancy cars, the fashion labels, the latest trends.<br>
When did we decide that other people’s opinions of us would dictate our own happiness? 
</p><p>
You see, it all started with a story.<br>
A story that we’ve been told since before we can even remember.<br>
The story goes like this.<br>
<strong>We are born incomplete.</strong><br>
And it’s our mission in life to try to complete ourselves.<br>
To fill this hole.<br>
It really is that simple.<br>
Or so it seems.
</p><p>
So every year we spend billions of dollars trying to fill this hole.<br>
Trying to complete ourselves.<br>
Because that’s how it works.<br>
And hey, everyone else is doing it.<br>
Well spoiler alert: <strong>We can’t fill the hole.</strong><br>
Trust me, I’ve tried.<br>
So what if we stopped believing the story?<br>
What if we stopped believing we were incomplete?
</p><p>
Well, for starters, we would probably stop buying things to fill the hole.<br>
We would probably stop posting things on social media to fill the hole.<br>
And we would probably stop eating and drinking things to fill the hole.<br>
Because guess what?<br>
<i>The hole doesn’t exist.</i><br>
It never has.<br>
It’s just something we chose and continue to choose to believe.
</p><p>
We choose to believe this story, but the more I think about it, the more I realize.<br>
We don’t have to anymore.<br>
</p><p>
Do we?
