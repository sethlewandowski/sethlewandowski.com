<h1>Coping with the Monumental Days</h1>
<small>August 15, 2019</small>
</header>
<p>
We all have those days where we feel on top of the world.<br>
Where we feel like we've accomplished in one day what normally takes a month.
</p><p>
The problem comes in the aftermath.<br>
How can I be okay with a "good" day when I've just had a "monumental" day?
</p><p>
We can't.<br>
It's not you, it's all of us. 
</p><p>
It's our biology.<br>
We are programmed to never be satisfied, never be content. 
</p><p>
We always want more.<br>
And if you don't believe me, then take a look around. 
</p><p>
How else can you explain the stories of people achieving greatness only to commit suicide a few years later?<br>
It's never enough.<br>
No matter how high we reach.
</p><p>
The way I see it, we have one option - <strong>set an expectation</strong>.<br>
Then, once we've set an expectation, we must be thrilled when we reach it. 
</p><p>
Here's my daily expectation (M-F):
<ol>
  <li>Accomplish 3 tasks</li>
  <li>Exercise</li>
  <li>Learn 1 new thing</li>
</ol>
</p><p>
It's that simple.<br>
And if we're unwilling to allow it to be simple, then we're asking for dissatisfaction.<br>
And that's bad for everyone.
</p><p>
If we're shooting for the highest highs which make the lows all the lower, we must make an agreement with ourselves to be happy with a daily, achievable outcome. 
</p><p>
The monumental days will come. These are my thoughts on making the everyday days a little less...<br>
Meh.
