<h1>In Loving Memory…</h1>

<p>
Liberty, a.k.a. Libby, Lib, Berto, Bert.<br>
We’re gonna miss you, girl. You were always such a flirt.<br>
But you were truly an awesome dog – you never went and dug up any dirt.<br>
And this, I can promise you, letting you go, man, it makes our hearts hurt.
</p><p>
It’s funny how people are searching high and low for any signs to prove this story of God is true,<br>
When all they have to do is take one look at a dog like you.<br>
Then they could easily see that God is here right now, showing his love to us through you.<br>
And proving to us that each and every day we really can wake up and start fresh, start anew.
</p><p>
I think it’s fair to say a “thank you” is in order, Berto.<br>
For the unconditional love you showed to us, even now, as you prepare to go.<br>
But rest assured that where you’re going, you won’t be solo.<br>
Caus your best friend Major is already up there waiting for you, completely free of pain, nope not even a hurt toe.
</p><p>
May you cross this bridge with courage and peace,<br>
Knowing your impact and memory in our minds will never cease.
</p><p>
This isn’t “Goodbye” but rather just “See you later”, girl.<br>
We owe it to you to get back on this carousel of life and give it a Berto-worthy whirl.
</p><p>

Rest in Peace, Bert. Thanks for showing us what unconditional love is really like.
