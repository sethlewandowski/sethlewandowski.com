<p>
Blah, blah, blah.<br>
It’s just words on a page.<br>
Who reads this stuff anyway?<br>
You’ll never make the stage.
</p><p>
The compulsion to create.<br>
The desire to dream.<br>
We all have the itch inside.<br>
The problem lies in the small fraction of those who abide.
</p><p>
Why is art so taboo?<br>
Reserved only for the poor and the few.
</p><p>
We all have a story to tell.<br>
And for some, you’d probably prefer to yell.<br>
When will you have the courage to try?<br>
Not like anyone is asking you to jump off a cliff and fly.
</p><p>
It’s those who are closest to us that can hold us back the most.<br>
They can keep you from ever having the courage to write that first post.<br>
But let me challenge you and say, “So what?”<br>
If you have the itch, stand up and follow your gut.<br>
Taking action is the only thing that's gonna get you out of that rut.
</p><p>
“Oh, here we go, another one of these hype-poems from a closet creator.”<br>
To that, I say, “My names on the site and the comment box is open, ya hater.”
</p><p>
I can promise you that this world would be better.<br>
And “Tomorrow” really is just another word for “Never.”<br>
What can you create today?<br>
Can you put a pen to paper?<br>
It’s funny how quickly your world can change when you discover that you,<br>
Yes, I said you, might just be born to be a shaper.
