<h1>Fewer. Higher Quality.</h1>
<small>April 3, 2019</small>
</header>

<p>
There truly is something beautiful about simplicity.<br>
In a world where we are constantly bombarded by options, features, add-ons, and colors, there’s something almost euphoric about seeing a sole tree in a field.
</p><p>
My journey to simplicity started with moving from Tulsa to San Francisco back in 2015…<br>
But….<br>
You probably don’t care about that. Do you?<br> 
So let’s skip the lame “Here’s my background and why I’m qualified to speak on this” story.
</p><p>
We’ve been trained to think that options are good.<br> 
And the more options we have, the better.<br> 
I don’t think this is as true as we once thought.
</p><p>
For example, what happens when you go to the gym?<br> 
You walk in, and see 50 machines, 150 dumbbells, and 30 cardio machines.<br>
Options.<br>
Options.<br>
Options.<br>
Should I do some cardio?<br>
Maybe I’ll start with a circuit.<br>
I wonder if that spin instructor, Mike, is teaching tonight.<br>
Ooo I could go sit in the sauna.<br>
Nah, screw it, I’ll just go get a cheeseburger and some fries and call it a night.<br>
</p><p>
I don’t know about you, but for me, this creates analysis paralysis.<br>
I sit there and wonder what I should do.<br>
What I could do.<br>
What I’m supposed to do.<br>
Should this be leg day, cardio day, core day?<br>
I could play basketball.<br>
You get the point.
</p><p>
I just moved into a new apartment and have a home gym.<br>
It’s a yoga mat (Gaiam Sol Dry-Grip).<br>
A 55lb kettlebell (Yeah, you could say I’m pretty buff).<br>
And a human (Me - I don't like to make any assumptions).<br>
</p><p>
And I’ve worked out more in the last week than I have in the last 2 months.<br>
This is because working out is a process now. Not an art.<br>
Bear with me here, because that last distinction is the whole point.
</p><p>
I believe that we are surrounded by art, and surrounded by opportunities to create art and express ourselves through that art.<br>
We can draw.<br>
We can dress.<br>
We can capture.<br>
We can write.<br>
We can mix.<br>
We can design.<br>
We can turn just about anything we do into art.
<br>
And that’s the danger here.<br>
And perhaps the question – Are we capable of unlimited creative output?
</p><p>
I believe that we are only capable of a finite level of creative output per day.
</p><p>
How long can you run continuously?<br>
Stay awake continuously?<br>
Squat jump continuously?<br>
Focus continuously?<br>
Learn continuously?<br>
Run continuously?<br>
Shop continuously?<br>
Eat continuously?<br>
Sleep continuously?
</p><p>
There are parts of our lives that we’d be better off turning into a process, rather than an art, and leaving our artistic output for other, more important things.
</p><p>
Your artistic output could be meal creation.<br>
What you wear.<br>
What your workout is.<br>
What you write after work.<br>
What you journal before bed.<br>
What you record on your phone.<br>
The photos you take during your lunch break.<br>
The cocktail you mix on Friday night.<br>
The proposal you write for work.<br>
The sales tactic you use tomorrow.<br>
The date you plan for Saturday night.
</p><p>
How much of your fixed creative output do you really want to spend on unimportant, impermanent things?
</p><p>
All I can really do is share my personal experience, because I’m not an expert, nor do I think that what works for me will work for everyone.
</p><p>
But what I have found is by “processing” what I wear, eat, and do for exercise, I’ve created mental space for more artistic output for what I work on, dream about, and create.
</p><p>
If you’re like me, you crave simplicity.<br>
You crave quiet.<br>
Peace.<br>
Not always.<br>
But sometimes.<br>
Okay, most times.<br>
Fine, like 98% of the time, okay?!
</p><p>
Today I was looking for a decent, free accounting software for my personal LLC revenue and expense tracking and came across an article with 8 different ads firing at once.<br>
Nice, Forbes.com.<br>
I hope you’re making tons of money because you’re ruing the power of advertising for all of us.
</p><p>
This is the kind of behavior that leads to ruin.
</p><p>
A little leverage is great.<br>
A lot of leverage led to 2008.<br>
A little sugar is great<br>
A lot of sugar leads to type II diabetes.<br>
A little advertising is great.<br>
A lot of advertising leads to population-wide distrust and blindness.
</p><p>
I guess what I am trying to say is, if there’s an area you’re struggling with in life, consider whether you’ve unnecessarily overcomplicated it.
</p><p>
Do you really need to go to Walmart Supercenter and walk every isle to get your groceries?<br>
Do you really need a $120/month gym membership to stay in shape?<br>
Do you really need to spend 2 hours on Facebook every day to feel connected?<br>
Do you really need all 800+ channels on cable TV?<br> 
Do you really need a Netflix, Hulu, and YouTubeTV subscription?<br>
Do you really need 25 pairs of shoes?<br>
Do you really need to browse Amazon.com to find your next perfect kitchen appliance.<br>
</p><p>
There is beauty in simplicity. And if you aren’t there yet, you just have a higher tolerance for the noise than I do.
</p><p>
But with each day that goes by, the decibels go up.<br>
The ads go up.<br>
The options go up.<br>
The choices go up.<br>
The variants go up.<br>
</p><p>
Yeah, minimalism serves me to an extent.<br>
And wearing the same type of T-shirt, pants, and shoes every day serves me to some extent.<br>
And limiting myself to 15 minutes a day of Instagram serves me to some extent.<br>
And eating the same boring breakfast serves me to some extent.
</p><p>
A wise man once said, “Too many choices confuse the buyer.”
</p><p>
Have you ever gone to a restaurant and looked through a 6 page menu only to see 15 minutes of your life pass before you’ve even had a chance to consider what sounds good?
</p><p>
I think we’ve allowed ourselves to swing way too far to one side of the pendulum.
That side being – <strong>More is always better</strong>.
</p><p>
I’d argue there’s actually more happiness to be found in fewer and higher quality things.<br>
Relationships<br>
Apps<br>
Shoes<br>
Workouts<br>
Hats<br>
Apps<br>
Handbags<br>
Grocery items
</p><p>
We’ve tried this whole “More is always better” thing.
</p><p>
Perhaps it’s time to try this whole “Fewer, higher quality” thing?
